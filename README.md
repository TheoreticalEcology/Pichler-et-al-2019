# Pichler-et-al-2019 

This repository contains the code used in [Pichler, Maximilian, et al. "Machine learning algorithms to infer trait‚Äêmatching and predict species interactions in ecological networks." Methods in Ecology and Evolution 11.2 (2020): 281-293.](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13329)

The definite snapshot of the code used in the paper was stored in [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/177774609.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/177774609)

The repo contains two subfolders: 

* The code to reproduce [Results and Supporting Information](https://github.com/TheoreticalEcology/Pichler-et-al-2019/tree/master/paper)

* An [R package](https://github.com/TheoreticalEcology/Pichler-et-al-2019/tree/master/TraitMatching), which implements the core methods used in the paper. 

*Note*: the code (and in particular the R package) uses a previous version of the MLR package. If you are working with the latest version of MLR (3 or later), it will not run. You can either downgrade to the old version, or, if you are just interested in applying these methods to your own data, use this new implementation of our methods, which is compatible with MLR 3 https://github.com/MaximilianPi/TraitMatching
